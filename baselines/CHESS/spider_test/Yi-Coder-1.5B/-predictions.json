Then it selects the columns from the `club_query` and joins it with the `club` table based on the `Club_ID`. The `UNION ALL` operation is used to combine the results of the subquery and the main query. The `distinct` keyword is used to ensure that duplicate rows are not included in the final result.  Finally, it aggregates the result using `xmlagg` function to create an XML string. The `to_xml` function is used to convert the column values to XML format. The `SEPARATOR ', '` is used to separate the XML elements with a comma.\t----- bird -----\tsoccer_3",

We need to find the `Date` from the `receipts` table that corresponds to a `ReceiptNumber` from the `items` table where the `Item` from the `items` table is in the `goods` table where `Price` from the `goods` table is over 15 dollars.  Here is the SQL query using Recursive Divide-and-Conquer approach:   DECLARE RECURSIVE result AS (     SELECT          r.Date,          i.Item,          g.Price     FROM          receipts r         JOIN items i ON r.ReceiptNumber = i.Receipt         JOIN goods g ON i.Item = g.Id     WHERE          g.Price > 15     UNION ALL     SELECT          r.Date,          i.Item,          g.Price     FROM          result r         JOIN items i ON r.Date = i.Date         JOIN goods g ON i.Item = g.Id         JOIN receipts re ON re.ReceiptNumber = i.Receipt     WHERE          g.Price > 15 );  SELECT      result.Date FROM      result ORDER BY      result.Date DESC LIMIT 1;   This SQL query uses a recursive common table expression (CTE) `result` to solve the problem. The `UNION ALL` operation is used to combine the results of the subqueries. The final result is selected from the `result` CTE. The `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT 1` are used to get the latest date.
